// WithResubscription wraps the subscribe function to call it repeatedly
// to keep a subscription alive. When a subscription is established, it is
// monitored and in the case of a failure, resubscribe is attempted by
// calling the subscribe function again.
//
// The mechanism applies backoff between resubscription attempts.
// The time between calls is adapted based on the error rate, but will never
// exceed backoffMax.
//
// The mechanism monitors the time elapsed between resubscription attempts and
// if it is shorter than the specificed alertThreshold, it calls
// thresholdViolatedFn passing the time elapsed between resubscription attempts.
// This function alarms about potential problems with the stability of the
// subscription.
//
// In case of an error returned by the wrapped subscription function,
// subscriptionFailedFn is called with the underlying error.
//
// thresholdViolatedFn and subscriptionFailedFn calls are executed in a separate
// goroutine and thus are non-blocking.
